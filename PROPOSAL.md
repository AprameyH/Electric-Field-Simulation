#Project Proposal
For my final project, I plan on simulating the electric field around charged particles, similar to https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/charges-and-fields/latest/charges-and-fields_en.html.

I've studied electric fields in courses I've taken and I think I have a satisfactory understanding of the physics concepts involved. 
I'm interested in this project because I used to find it tough to visualize field lines for different arrangements of charged particles, and I think it would be nice to build something useful.

By the end of week 1, I plan on having completed a simulation that displays an electric field for a single particle in a fixed location.
By the end of week 2, I plan to have implemented the ability to add new particles that can be positioned by the user. 
By the end of week 3, each particle will be able to be positioned by dragging and dropping. I plan to have implemented a feature that visualizes the strength of the electric field at any specified point.

If I finish the project early, I will implement a method to set values to individual charges, and a method to find equipotentials.
